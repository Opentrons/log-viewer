# Log Viewer release hosting

GitHub Actions uploads signed Log Viewer installers to the existing builds website
buckets, under `logviewer/` — the same pattern as the desktop app's `app/` prefix.

| Channel | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Release | https://builds.opentrons.com/logviewer |
| Internal | https://ot3-development.builds.opentrons.com/logviewer |

This stack does **not** create those buckets. It creates an IAM role that GitHub
Actions assumes via OIDC, with object access limited to the `logviewer/` prefix.

## Apply

Requires the same AWS profiles as `robot-stack-infra` (`terraform-state` and
`robotics_robot_stack_prod-admin`).

```sh
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
# optional: pass the builds.opentrons.com CloudFront ID so the role can invalidate
# terraform apply -var='builds_cloudfront_distribution_id=<id from release-ci>'
```

## GitHub Actions variables

After apply:

1. Set `OT_LOGVIEWER_DEPLOY_ROLE` to `terraform output -raw log_viewer_github_oidc_role_arn`.
2. Optionally set `OT_LOGVIEWER_BUILDS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` to the
   `builds.opentrons.com` distribution ID (same value as
   `OT_APP_BUILDS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` in Opentrons/opentrons).
